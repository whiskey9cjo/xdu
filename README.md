Builds partitioned Parquet indexes for instant analytics on filesystems with hundreds of millions of files.

## Motivation

System administrators managing large shared storage (e.g., HPC clusters, research computing, NAS appliances) need to regularly audit disk usage and file access patterns. Common tasks include:

- Identifying users consuming excessive space
- Finding stale data for purge policies
- Generating usage reports by user or project
- Enforcing quotas and retention policies

Traditional tools like `du` and `find` are designed for interactive, one-off queries. They re-traverse the filesystem every time, which is prohibitively slow on systems with hundreds of millions of files. They also produce flat text output that's difficult to analyze at scale.

**xdu** solves this by building a persistent, queryable index once—then enabling instant analytics via the included `xdu-find` command, interactive exploration with `xdu-view`, or external tools like DuckDB, Polars, or Apache Spark.

## Design

### Partitioned Output

The index is partitioned by top-level subdirectory. For a `/home` filesystem:

```
index/
├── alice/
│   ├── 000000.parquet
│   └── 000001.parquet
├── bob/
│   └── 000000.parquet
└── charlie/
    └── 000000.parquet
```

This layout enables:
- **Partition pruning**: Query a single user's data without scanning the entire index
- **Parallel writes**: Each partition is processed independently
- **Incremental updates**: Re-index individual partitions without rebuilding everything

### Schema

| Column | Type  | Description                         |
|--------|-------|-------------------------------------|
| path   | UTF-8 | Absolute file path                  |
| size   | INT64 | File size in bytes                  |
| uid    | INT64 | Owning user id                      |
| gid    | INT64 | Owning group id                     |
| mode   | INT64 | Permission bits (st_mode & 07777)   |
| atime  | INT64 | Last access time (Unix epoch)       |
| mtime  | INT64 | Last modification time (Unix epoch) |
| ctime  | INT64 | Last inode-change time (Unix epoch) |

### Performance

**Why xdu is faster than `du` for this use-case:**

1. **Adaptive parallel traversal**: Using jwalk, threads dynamically balance work at every directory level—no partition gets bottlenecked to a single thread
2. **Parallel metadata**: File stat() calls happen in parallel within the thread pool, critical for high-latency network filesystems
3. **Columnar storage**: Parquet compresses paths efficiently (often 10:1) and enables predicate pushdown
4. **Buffered writes**: Records accumulate in memory before flushing, minimizing I/O syscalls
5. **One traversal, many queries**: Build the index once, query it thousands of times instantly

A typical 100M file filesystem might take 2-3 hours to `du`. With xdu, the index builds in 20-30 minutes and subsequent queries complete in seconds.

## Installation

### Quick Install (Recommended)

```bash
curl -sSfL https://xdu-project.org/install.sh | sh
```

This downloads the latest release binary for your platform and installs it to `~/.local/bin`.

**Options:**
- `XDU_VERSION=v0.1.0` — Install a specific version
- `XDU_INSTALL=/usr/local/bin` — Change install directory

### From Source

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/xdu-project/xdu.git
```

Requires [Rust](https://rustup.rs) nightly toolchain.

### Containers

Container specs for Docker and Apptainer/Singularity live in [`hpccm/`](hpccm/), generated
from a single [HPCCM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/hpc-container-maker) recipe. They install
the published release binaries with no Rust toolchain, so they finish in seconds; see
[`hpccm/README.md`](hpccm/README.md) for usage. They track release tags, not the working
tree — for unreleased commits, build from source instead.

## Usage

### Building an Index

```bash
xdu /home -o /var/lib/xdu/home -j 16 -b 100000
```

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `-o, --outdir` | Output directory for index | Required |
| `-j, --jobs` | Parallel threads (`XDU_JOBS` env) | 4 |
| `-B, --buffsize` | Records per Parquet chunk | 100000 |

| `--apparent-size` | Report file length instead of disk usage (st_blocks) | |
| `-k, --block-size` | Round sizes up to block size (e.g., `128K`). Implies `--apparent-size` | |

### Querying with xdu-find

The `xdu-find` command provides a convenient CLI for common queries:

```bash
# Find all Python files
xdu-find -i /var/lib/xdu/home -p '*.py'

# Find large files (>1GB) not accessed in 90 days
xdu-find -i /var/lib/xdu/home --min-size 1G --older-than 90

# Query a specific user's partition, sorted by size
xdu-find -i /var/lib/xdu/home -u alice --min-size 100M -f size

# Count matching files
xdu-find -i /var/lib/xdu/home -p '*.tmp' --older-than 30 --count

# Pipe to xargs for bulk operations
xdu-find -i /var/lib/xdu/home -p '*.tmp' --older-than 30 | xargs rm
```

| `--newer-than` | Files accessed within N days | |
| `--owner` | Files owned by this user (name or uid) | |
| `--group` | Files owned by this group (name or gid) | |
| `--mode` | Permission filter: `644` exact, `/002` any-bit, `&4000` all-bit | |
| `--mtime-older-than` | Files not modified in N days | |
| `--mtime-newer-than` | Files modified within N days | |
| `-f, --format` | Output format: path, size, atime, csv, json | path |
| `-l, --limit` | Limit number of results | |
| `-c, --count` | Count matching records | |

### Interactive Exploration with xdu-view

The `xdu-view` command provides an ncdu-style TUI for browsing the index interactively, with powerful filtering and sorting capabilities.

```bash
# Browse all partitions
xdu-view -i /var/lib/xdu/home

# Start in a specific partition
xdu-view -i /var/lib/xdu/home -u alice

# View only files not accessed in 30 days, sorted by size
xdu-view -i /var/lib/xdu/home --older-than 30 -s size-desc

# View large Python files (>1MB)
xdu-view -i /var/lib/xdu/home -p '*.py' --min-size 1M
```

▸ tests                      128.50 MiB      892 files    1 month ago
  README.md                    4.50 KiB        1 file     today
```

#### Common Use Cases

**Find where old data is hiding:**
```bash
# Launch with 90-day stale filter, sorted by size
xdu-view -i /var/lib/xdu/home --older-than 90 -s size-desc
```
Drill down into the largest directories to find purgeable data.

**Audit a specific user's storage:**
```bash
# Jump directly to a user, show files >100MB
xdu-view -i /var/lib/xdu/home -u alice --min-size 100M
```

**Identify recently active directories:**
```bash
# Show only data accessed in the last 7 days
xdu-view -i /var/lib/xdu/home --newer-than 7 -s count-desc
```

**Find specific file types:**
```bash
# Explore all Jupyter notebooks
xdu-view -i /var/lib/xdu/home -p '*.ipynb' -s size-desc
```

### Bulk Deletion with xdu-rm

The `xdu-rm` command enables safe, parallel deletion of files matching query criteria. This is essential for enforcing retention policies at scale—purging millions of stale files that traditional `find | xargs rm` workflows can't handle efficiently.

```bash
# Preview files that would be deleted (dry-run)
xdu-rm -i /var/lib/xdu/home --older-than 60 --dry-run

# Delete files not accessed in 60 days, with confirmation
xdu-rm -i /var/lib/xdu/home --older-than 60

# Delete with 16 parallel threads for faster purging
xdu-rm -i /var/lib/xdu/home --older-than 60 -j 16 --force

# Delete only .tmp files older than 30 days in alice's partition
xdu-rm -i /var/lib/xdu/home -u alice -p '*.tmp' --older-than 30 --force
```

#### Command-Line Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `-i, --index` | Path to Parquet index directory | Required |
| `-p, --pattern` | Glob pattern to match paths (e.g., `*.py`) | |
| `--regex` | Interpret `--pattern` as a regular expression | |
| `-u, --partition` | Filter by partition (user directory) | |
| `--min-size` | Minimum file size (e.g., 1K, 10M, 1G) | |
| `--max-size` | Maximum file size | |
| `--older-than` | Files not accessed in N days | |
| `--newer-than` | Files accessed within N days | |
| `-l, --limit` | Maximum number of files to delete | |
| `-n, --dry-run` | Show what would be deleted without deleting | |
| `--safe` | Verify file metadata before deletion | |
| `-f, --force` | Skip confirmation prompt | |
| `-v, --verbose` | Show per-file deletion status | |
| `-j, --jobs` | Number of parallel threads | 4 |

#### Safe Mode: Protecting Recently Accessed Files

The `--safe` flag addresses a critical edge case: **the index may be stale**. If you built the index yesterday and a user accessed their "old" file today, the index still shows the old access time. Without `--safe`, that file would be incorrectly deleted.

With `--safe` enabled, `xdu-rm` performs a fresh `stat()` on each file immediately before deletion and verifies:

- **For `--older-than`**: The file's current atime is still older than the threshold
- **For `--max-size`**: The file's current size still meets the criteria

Files that no longer match are skipped:

```bash
# Safe deletion: re-check atime before each delete
xdu-rm -i /var/lib/xdu/home --older-than 60 --safe --force -v

# Output shows protected files:
# SKIP (accessed since index): /home/alice/important_data.csv
# DELETE: /home/bob/old_cache.tmp
# ...
# Deleted: 1,234,567
# Skipped (safe mode): 42
```

**When to use `--safe`:**
- Production purge workflows where data loss is unacceptable
- When the index is more than a few hours old
- When users may have accessed files between indexing and purging

**When `--safe` may not be needed:**
- Immediately after building a fresh index
- When deleting from a read-only ZFS snapshot (files can't change)
- For low-risk file types (e.g., `.tmp`, `.cache`)

#### Common Workflows

**Enforce 60-day retention policy:**
```bash
# Nightly cron job with safe mode
0 3 * * * xdu-rm -i /var/lib/xdu/home --older-than 60 --safe -j 16 --force >> /var/log/xdu-purge.log 2>&1
```

**Clean up scratch space aggressively:**
```bash
# Delete files older than 7 days, no safe mode needed for scratch
xdu-rm -i /var/lib/xdu/scratch --older-than 7 -j 32 --force
```

**Targeted cleanup by file type:**
```bash
# Remove old Jupyter checkpoints
xdu-rm -i /var/lib/xdu/home --regex -p '/\.ipynb_checkpoints/' --older-than 30 --force

# Remove old core dumps
xdu-rm -i /var/lib/xdu/home --regex -p '/core\.\d+$' --older-than 7 --force
```

**Preview before production:**
```bash
# Always dry-run first to verify the query
xdu-rm -i /var/lib/xdu/home --older-than 60 --min-size 1G --dry-run | head -20

# Check count
xdu-rm -i /var/lib/xdu/home --older-than 60 --min-size 1G --dry-run | tail -1
# 847,231 file(s) would be deleted.
```

### Querying with DuckDB

The Parquet index integrates seamlessly with DuckDB for instant analytics:

```sql
-- Total usage per user
SELECT
    regexp_extract(path, '/home/([^/]+)/', 1) AS user,
    sum(size) / 1e12 AS tb
FROM read_parquet('/var/lib/xdu/home/*/*.parquet')
GROUP BY user
ORDER BY tb DESC;

-- Files not accessed in 180 days
SELECT path, size, atime
FROM read_parquet('/var/lib/xdu/home/*/*.parquet')
WHERE atime < epoch(now()) - 86400 * 180
ORDER BY size DESC
LIMIT 100;

-- Query single user (partition pruning)
SELECT sum(size) / 1e9 AS gb
FROM read_parquet('/var/lib/xdu/home/alice/*.parquet');
```

## Scheduling

Run xdu via cron to maintain a fresh index:

```cron
0 2 * * * /usr/local/bin/xdu /home -o /var/lib/xdu/home -j 32
```

## Pro Tips

### Index ZFS Snapshots for Point-in-Time Accuracy

On large ZFS filesystems (multi-petabyte scale), a full index can take 8-12+ hours. During that time, users may create, modify, or delete files—leading to an index that represents a "smeared" view of the filesystem rather than a consistent point-in-time snapshot.

For accurate auditing, **index a ZFS snapshot instead of the live filesystem**:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# snapshot-index.sh - Atomic snapshot + index workflow

POOL="tank/home"
SNAP="$POOL@xdu-$(date +%Y%m%d)"
MOUNT="/mnt/xdu-snapshot"
INDEX="/var/lib/xdu/home"

# Create snapshot (instantaneous)
zfs snapshot "$SNAP"

# Mount read-only
mkdir -p "$MOUNT"
mount -t zfs -o ro "$SNAP" "$MOUNT"

# Build index from snapshot
xdu "$MOUNT" -o "$INDEX" -j 32

# Cleanup
umount "$MOUNT"
zfs destroy "$SNAP"

echo "Index complete: $INDEX"
```

**Benefits:**
- **Consistency**: The index reflects an exact point-in-time state
- **Safety**: Indexing a read-only snapshot eliminates any risk of accidental modification
- **Reproducibility**: If questions arise about the data, you can re-mount the same snapshot
- **No user impact**: Snapshot creation is instantaneous; users don't experience slowdowns

For rolling retention, keep the last few snapshots:

```bash
# Keep snapshots for 7 days
zfs destroy tank/home@xdu-$(date -d '7 days ago' +%Y%m%d) 2>/dev/null || true
```

### Incremental Partition Updates

If only a few users have changed significantly, re-index just their partitions:

```bash
# Re-index only alice's data
xdu /home -o /var/lib/xdu/home -j 8 --partition alice
```

This is much faster than a full re-index and automatically prunes stale chunks from previous runs.

### Adaptive Parallelism

Unlike traditional one-thread-per-partition approaches, xdu uses jwalk's adaptive parallelism. Work is dynamically distributed at every directory level:

- When a thread enters a directory with many subdirectories, those subdirectories are redistributed across idle threads
- This eliminates the "long tail" problem where a few large partitions bottleneck the entire crawl
- A filesystem with 1000 small partitions and 5 "whale" partitions (30M+ files each) now completes in 3-4 hours instead of 10+ hours
