# AGENTS.md

Guidance for coding agents (Claude Code and others) working in this repository.
`CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file — edit `AGENTS.md`, never a separate copy. (Warp reads
`AGENTS.md` directly, so there is no separate `WARP.md`.) `.claude` is likewise a symlink to
`.agents`, so Claude Code discovers the factory skills and settings through it.

This document is the operating manual: the architecture, the load-bearing invariants, and the
process rules an autonomous agent needs to make correct, safe changes here without rediscovering
them each session. When something below disagrees with the code, **the code is ground truth — fix
this file.**

## Project

**xdu** is a high-performance filesystem indexer and query suite for large-scale storage
administration (HPC / enterprise: hundreds of millions to billions of files) where `du`(1) and
`find`(1) are too slow for regular auditing. You point it at a directory tree; it builds a
persistent, queryable **Parquet index partitioned by top-level subdirectory** once, then answers
size/age/pattern questions instantly. The directory names are bare, not Hive `key=value` pairs, so
DuckDB derives no partition column from them and partition scoping comes from the glob
(`lib::index_glob`) rather than from partition metadata.

Five binaries (`Cargo.toml [[bin]]`), four user-facing plus one build helper:

| Binary | Role |
|--------|------|
| **`xdu`** | Crawler/indexer — walks a tree, writes the eight-column Parquet index (path, size, uid, gid, mode, atime, mtime, ctime). |
| **`xdu-find`** | Query CLI — DuckDB over the index; filters + `--count`/`--top`/formats. |
| **`xdu-view`** | ncdu-style interactive TUI (ratatui/crossterm); read-only list + tree views. |
| **`xdu-rm`** | **Destructive** bulk deletion of files matching an index query, with `--safe` re-stat. |
| **`gen-completions`** | Dev helper — emits bash+zsh completions from the `src/cli.rs` clap structs. |

The index schema is deliberately minimal: `path` (UTF-8), `size` (INT64 bytes), `uid`,
`gid` and `mode` (INT64 owner, group, and permission bits), `atime`, `mtime` and `ctime`
(INT64 Unix epoch seconds). It is **Unix-only** (`std::os::unix::fs::MetadataExt` for times,
ownership, and disk usage). Snappy compression. Queries use the **bundled** DuckDB (`duckdb` crate, `bundled`
feature) so there is no external DuckDB dependency.

## Environment & working rules

- **Commit only when explicitly asked.** When you do: this is **GitHub Flow on `main`** — branch
  off `main` (`feature/{slug}` or `fix/{slug}`), open a **squash** PR back to `main`. There is no
  `develop` branch; releases are `vX.Y.Z` tags on `main`.
- **Commit subjects follow `[category] Imperative summary`.** Common categories: `feature`, `fix`,
  `docs`, `ci`, `refactor`, `test`, `release` (version bumps / rebuilt assets), and `harness` (the
  `.agents/` factory). This set is **not closed** — coin a new lowercase category when one fits.
  Subject length, and the wrapping of the body, are stated once in § *Prose and comments*.
- **No `Co-Authored-By:` trailer on commits** — it is noise in `git log`. Authorship/AI-assistance
  is tracked in the **PR body** instead, which ends with an attribution trailer naming the
  actual harness, model, and variant.
- **Version is single-sourced from `Cargo.toml`** — never hardcode a version string in `src/`; read it
  from `CARGO_PKG_VERSION` (the completion marker does, `crawl.rs`). All four `#[command(...)]`
  blocks in `src/cli.rs` set `version`, so clap derives `-V`/`--version` from `Cargo.toml` for every
  user-facing binary.
- **A CLI change updates its `doc/*.scd` man page source in the same commit.** Shell completions
  regenerate automatically from `src/cli.rs` (`gen-completions`), so they are not committed; the
  generated `share/` tree is git-ignored (built in CI and by `/xdu-release`).
- **Commit-message hook** — `.githooks/commit-msg` reflows the body to ≤80 columns (subject,
  comments, and indented literal lines pass through untouched; a subject past 72 earns a warning,
  not a failure). Enable per clone with `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`. Write the body as
  flowing paragraphs; the hook wraps them.
- **Delete with `del`, never `rm`** — and read the exceptions in the next bullet before applying this
  to committed code. `del` ([`delete-cli`](https://pypi.org/project/delete-cli/), the maintainer's)
  moves a path to the `$HOME` trash instead of unlinking it, so a mistake is recoverable: `del PATH…`
  removes, `del --list` shows what is there, `del --restore PATH` undoes, `del --empty` reclaims. This
  binds **every** harness working in this repo, not just Claude Code. It is about the *act*, not the
  spelling — any irreversible removal of something you did not just create counts, whether written
  `rm`, `find -delete`, `git clean -fdx`, `shutil.rmtree` or `truncate`. Three sharp edges, each
  measured: **`-r` means `--restore`, not recursive** — `del -r dir` exits 0 and deletes *nothing*,
  while plain `del dir` handles directories natively; there is **no `-f`**, and while a missing path
  is exit 0, a *usage* error is not (`del -rf` exits 2), so do not assume success; and `del` needs a
  real `$HOME` — unset, it writes `.Trash/` and `.Trash.db` into the working directory, and under a
  redirected `$HOME` (as `tests/offline_tests.rs` and several `verify:` gates use) it lands in the
  fixture and reddens it. Not on `PATH`? In order: `uvx --from delete-cli del …` (ephemeral, installs
  nothing), else `uv tool install delete-cli` once. If neither resolves — no `uv`, no network — **stop
  and ask.** The interactive shell defines `rm` as a function that refuses, and routing around it with
  `command /bin/rm`, `\rm`, `env rm` or `sh -c 'rm …'` defeats a guardrail that exists on purpose.
  That bypass already happened here, and because the refusing `rm` **exits 0**, it read as a clean run
  while leaving `/usr/bin/false` installed as `target/release/xdu` for two later phases to measure.
- **…and the deletions that stay `rm`.** The rule above governs what an *agent* removes; it does not
  reach committed code, and converting these breaks things. Keep `rm` wherever there is no trash to
  move to, or nothing worth recovering: **container builds** (`Dockerfile` — the point of
  `rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*` is layer size, and a move keeps the bytes in the layer); **the
  installer** (`install.sh` runs on a stranger's machine via `curl | sh`, is POSIX `sh` with no Python,
  and must not seed their trash); **CI**, which has no `del`; **HPC operator instructions**
  (`bench/HPC-PROTOCOL.md`) — there `$HOME` is a small quota'd filesystem separate from the scratch one,
  so a trash move becomes a cross-device copy of a multi-million-file index; **the benchmark trees**
  (`bench/`), which reach millions of sparse files, where trashing frees no disk and puts a rename
  inside the timed region; **self-cleaning scratch** — any `mktemp -d` that its creator disposes of,
  script or agent alike; **a tool's own bookkeeping** (`git rm`, `git worktree remove`, `cargo clean`,
  `docker prune`), which maintains metadata a trash move would strand; **published examples**
  (`README.md`, `doc/*.scd`) that teach users `xdu-find … | xargs rm`; and **`xdu-rm` itself**, whose
  entire product purpose is to free blocks.

## Prose and comments

The comments, documentation and commit messages here have a voice. Keep it. The padding, hedging and
marketing adjectives that generated text tends toward cost a reader's confidence in code that is
otherwise correct, and this is a tool that unlinks files on shared storage — it has to be taken
seriously to be trusted with that. `src/lib.rs` and `src/crawl.rs` carry the voice; match them.

**Write:**

- Declarative statements. `// Presence attests that the whole run finished; the body only adds
  detail.` — not `// This function will check...`.
- The **why**, not the what. The code says what it does. A comment earns its place by naming a
  constraint, a failure mode, or a rejected alternative. The `RESERVED_INDEX_NAMES` guard iterates
  the list so that reserving a new name rejects it by construction; that reason is not recoverable
  from reading the loop.
- Concrete failure modes. "`_OUTDIR_/*/*.parquet` published as `OUTDIR//.parquet`, at exit 0" beats
  "escaping matters here". "All 16 destructive tests drove a stale `target/release/xdu-rm` while
  `cargo test` stayed green" beats "the fixture was unreliable".
- Whole sentences with terminal punctuation, in the style already in the file.

**Do not write:**

- Filler and hedging: "simply", "just", "note that", "it's worth noting", "essentially",
  "basically".
- Marketing adjectives: "comprehensive", "robust", "seamless", "powerful", "elegant", "blazing",
  "leverage", "utilize". If a property matters, state the measurement — `bench/` exists so a claim
  about crawl speed carries a number, a tree shape, and a noise floor.
- "This ensures that…", "This allows us to…", "In order to…" — usually a sentence that has not yet
  decided what it is claiming.
- Restatements of the adjacent line. A comment that paraphrases the code is worse than none.
- Emoji, decorative Unicode, or exclamation marks in a comment, a `doc/*.scd` page, or a commit
  message. A Rust macro `!` is not prose. There is none in `src/` or `doc/` today, and the
  decoration the project keeps is confined to PR bodies (`🔧 Harness feedback`, the attribution
  trailer).
- Bulleted lists where two sentences would do. Tables are for reference material; prose is for
  reasoning.

**Never embed feature-scoped spec ids** (`R#`, `P#`) in `src/`, `doc/*.scd` or `README.md`. They
restart per feature, live in `spec/{slug}/`, and mean nothing in the merged tree; provenance runs
`git blame → commit → PR → spec/{slug}/`. Nothing lints this, so it survives on review alone. Naming
stable things is fine: real functions, real constants (`ROOT_PARTITION`, `MARKER_READ_LIMIT`), real
environment variables (`XDU_INDEX`, `XDU_JOBS`), documented DuckDB or `scdoc` behavior.

### Commit messages

The subject is wrapped by hand; the body is reflowed by the `commit-msg` hook. None of the numbers
below is a convention borrowed from elsewhere.

- **Subject: 72 characters, hard**, counting the `[category] ` prefix. `git log --oneline` spends 8
  columns on the short SHA and a space, leaving 72 of an 80-column terminal. This costs
  human-authored commits nothing: 2 of the 60 non-`[harness]` subjects on `main` exceed it, against
  a mean of 46.9.
- **Body: wrapped at 80 by the hook**, after a blank line. Write flowing paragraphs and let the
  hook reflow them. That is what this repo already writes — of 453 body
  lines, 3% exceed 80 where 43% exceed 72, so 72 would impose a new standard rather than record the
  one in force. `git log` indents the body 4 columns, so an 80-wide body can fold in an exactly-80
  terminal; that is the accepted cost of matching the corpus.
- **Body: 8-12 lines, and the *why* only.** The diff says what changed; the body says why, what was
  rejected, and what it cost. The corpus runs p50 = 1 line and p90 = 12 over the 143 commits
  preceding this rule, with two outliers at 21 and 29 — both redesigns reversing a committed
  decision, and both reasoning rather than narration, which is the shape that earns the length. A
  body past 12 usually means the commit wants splitting.
- **A commit that adds prose does not restate it.** When the change is a seed, a roadmap entry or a
  doc page, the reasoning is already in the file, and repeating it doubles the maintenance surface
  to say nothing new. The body earns its place only with what the file cannot say: why now, why
  here, what this replaces.
- **Exempt from the body wrap:** a URL, a pasted error string, or a path longer than 80. Breaking
  one makes it uncopyable, so give it its own line and let it overrun.

**When a subject will not fit, reword it — never truncate.** Drop the article, name the thing
instead of describing it, or split an "and also…" clause into a second commit. What overflows is
usually *provenance* rather than summary, and provenance belongs in the body:

```
[harness] Close the class by evaluating a predicate

Finding: manpage-literal-assertion-fails-on-ubuntu F9
```

That subject is 51 characters. Committed with `(manpage-literal-assertion-fails-on-ubuntu F9)`
appended it was 117 — the inline form that `.agents/skills/xdu-harness/SKILL.md` templates, where a
41-character slug spends 57 of the 72 columns before the summary begins. That template is the one
place the cap was structural rather than a matter of wording, and it is why 15 of the 19 `[harness]`
subjects on `main` exceed 72. Moving the suffix to a body line brings 18 of the 19 inside. The
holdout carries no suffix and is simply too long a summary, which is the case the cap exists for.

**Branch commits are out of scope.** The `xdu-feature|plan|build|review` subject templates repeat
the slug and can exceed 72, but `/xdu-publish` squashes them into the PR title and none reaches
`main`. The **PR title is in scope** — it becomes the squash subject, and GitHub appends ` (#N)` to
it, so leave room.

### Markdown prose

Hard-wrap markdown at **100 columns**, by hand. That is this repository's measured width rather than
an aspiration: `AGENTS.md` runs p50 = 96, p90 = 102. A rule of 80 would put a fifth of the
constitution in violation of a standard it states about itself.

**Count characters, not bytes.** `awk 'length > 100'` reports 95 long lines in this file where a
character count finds 69; the difference is em dashes, at three bytes each.

Tables are exempt — a row cannot be wrapped without breaking it, and the two widest lines here (167
and 141) are both rows. Fenced code, link targets, and any single token wider than the column are
exempt for the same reason. `doc/*.scd` is exempt as well: its breaks are chosen for roff, not for
reading, and where the two rules conflict the line-start restrictions in **Commands** win, because
rewrapping is the fix for a leading `.` and escaping is not.

Rewrapping a paragraph produces a whole-paragraph diff, so reflow only the paragraphs you were
editing anyway. The ~55 pre-existing prose lines in the 101–104 band are grandfathered, not a
backlog; do not open a diff to chase them.

## Commands

Toolchain is pinned by **`rust-toolchain.toml`** (edition 2024; the crate uses let-chains). Do not
assume `nightly` — use the pinned toolchain.

```bash
cargo build --release                                   # all bins (bundled DuckDB C++ is the slow part)
cargo test                                              # lib unit tests + tests/ integration
cargo test --test rm_tests                              # one integration file
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings   # lint gate (must be clean)
cargo fmt --all -- --check                              # format gate

# Drive the real binaries against a throwaway index (never a real one):
.agents/factory/bin/temp_index.sh xdu-find --count
.agents/factory/bin/temp_index.sh sh -c 'xdu-rm --dry-run -p "\.log$" --force'

# Man page gate. INSTALL scdoc — without it a doc/*.scd defect reaches CI unseen:
brew install scdoc                     # macOS  (apt-get install -y scdoc on Debian/Ubuntu, as CI does)
for scd in doc/*.scd; do scdoc < "$scd" > /dev/null || echo "FAILED $scd"; done
scdoc < doc/xdu.1.scd | mandoc -Tutf8 | col -b   # read the PUBLISHED text, not just exit 0

# ...and to ASSERT a literal survived, match it the way CI does. Strip all whitespace from the page
# AND from the literal: mandoc breaks lines wherever the fill lands, including inside a token, so an
# un-normalized grep calls an intact literal missing. Your scdoc is probably not CI's — homebrew's
# escapes hyphen-minus, the distro package does not — so the un-normalized form can pass for you and
# fail on ubuntu-24.04. Keep this in lockstep with the "Assert critical literals" step in
# .github/workflows/test.yaml and its restatement in .agents/factory/invariants.md §13.
lit='OUTDIR/.xdu-complete'
scdoc < doc/xdu.1.scd | mandoc -Tutf8 | col -b | tr -d '[:space:]' |
  grep -qF -- "$(printf '%s' "$lit" | tr -d '[:space:]')" || echo "MISSING: $lit"

# A literal that occurs MORE THAN ONCE needs a count, not a presence check — `grep -q` is satisfied
# by the surviving copy, so corrupting one of two occurrences reads green here and red in CI, which
# asserts it as `2x:.partial suffix`. Count the same normalized way. Keep the needle specific enough
# that stripping whitespace cannot FUSE two adjacent tokens into a synthetic match: `e.g. partial`
# becomes `e.g.partial`, so count `.partial suffix`, never a bare `.partial`.
lit='.partial suffix'; want=2
got=$(scdoc < doc/xdu.1.scd | mandoc -Tutf8 | col -b | tr -d '[:space:]' |
  grep -oF -- "$(printf '%s' "$lit" | tr -d '[:space:]')" | wc -l | tr -d ' ') || got=0
[ "$got" -eq "$want" ] || echo "MISCOUNT: $lit — $got, expected $want"
```

**Rendering is not optional, and exit 0 is not sufficient.** `scdoc` markup fails in two ways: a
nesting error is loud (`*__root__*` — `_` opens italic inside bold) and exits 1, but a mis-escaped
literal is **silent at exit 0** — `_OUTDIR_/*/*.parquet` published as `OUTDIR//.parquet` because `*`
is bold markup, and a line *starting* with `.` has that period silently dropped. Escape a literal
asterisk `\*` and a double underscore `\_\_` (mid-word `_` as in `*XDU_INDEX*` is safe); never start
a line with `.` or `'` — **rewrap, never escape**: `\.` at line start deletes the rest of the line,
also silently. None of this is mechanically fixable — `*/*` is a corrupted glob in `xdu.1.scd` and a
legitimate bold-slash (the `/` key) in `xdu-view.1.scd`, so intent has to be read. Catching the
silent class requires diffing the rendered text against the literal you intended, which is what the
`mandoc | col -b` line above is for.

**A third mode is not a markup error at all: the literal is intact and still unfindable.** `mandoc`
fills each paragraph to its own width and will break a line *inside* a token — a bare roff `-` is a
legal break opportunity — so `OUTDIR/.xdu-complete` can publish as `OUTDIR/.xdu-` + newline +
`complete`. Collapsing newlines to spaces does not recover it (the break was *within* a word, not
between two), and `col -b` indents continuation lines with a literal TAB, which squeezing spaces
never touches. That is **layout, not content**: nothing is corrupt, and the fix is to compare with
all whitespace stripped from both sides — the second snippet above. Whether you ever see it depends
on your `scdoc`: 1.11.5 substitutes `\-` for a bare `-` (upstream `1d4143d`), ubuntu-24.04's 1.11.2
does not, so the same `.scd` yields two different roffs and a check can be green on your box while
`main` is red. Which is exactly what happened — the gate arrived already broken and had never once
been green in CI. The normalization now lives in three places that must change together:
`.github/workflows/test.yaml`'s assertion step, the snippet above, and
[`invariants.md`](.agents/factory/invariants.md) §13.

**Presence is the wrong question for a literal that appears twice.** `grep -q` is satisfied by
whichever copy survived, so corrupting exactly one of `doc/xdu.1.scd`'s two `.partial suffix`
occurrences is invisible to it — which is why CI counts that one (`2x:.partial suffix`) instead. The
same is true of every `*XDU_INDEX*` / `*XDU_JOBS*`: each appears twice on its page, once as a
cross-reference in the flag description and once as the `ENVIRONMENT` entry, so corrupting only the
`ENVIRONMENT` entry publishes a variable name that does not exist while a presence check stays green.
All of them are counted for that reason. **Whether a literal is duplicated is a fact about the page,
not about the literal** — adding one cross-reference to a `.scd` can duplicate a previously-unique
literal — so re-count when you edit a `.scd` that carries an asserted literal; nothing re-derives it
for you. A new page is not covered at all: the `check` list names four pages while the render step
globs `doc/*.scd`, so a fifth man page ships entirely unasserted. Both gaps are recorded in
[`issues/manpage-gate-coverage-gaps.md`](issues/manpage-gate-coverage-gaps.md).
A local presence check on a duplicated literal therefore *cannot* predict CI's verdict no matter how
correctly it normalizes; use the counting form above. Counting is what makes stripping whitespace
dangerous in the other direction: the strip is lossy and can fuse adjacent tokens into a match that
never appeared on the page, which is harmless for presence (at worst a false green) but a false
**red** for a count — so a counted needle must be specific enough that fusion cannot synthesize it.

```

Two repo-level trees sit outside `src/`: **`.agents/`** — the software factory (the
`xdu-feature|plan|build|review|publish` lifecycle skills plus operational siblings `xdu-harness`
(meta/maintenance), `xdu-release` (version cuts), and `xdu-roadmap` (seed retirement); `factory/` methodology, invariants, EARS,
templates, the non-Claude `portability.md` contract, and the `bin/` FSM scripts + `meta_status.py`);
and **`spec/{slug}/`** — the `GOAL/PLAN/TECH/REVIEW.md` + `META.md` records the factory produces and
**retains on merge**. `AGENTS.md` stays ground truth; `spec/{slug}/` is a point-in-time record of
intent. See `.agents/factory/methodology.md`.

**Where a deferral goes — four homes, one rule each.** A pass that decides not to fix something must
record it, and the destination is not a matter of taste:

| File | Holds | Written by |
|---|---|---|
| `spec/{slug}/META.md` | **Harness/skill feedback only** — "was this the *factory's* fault". Never code follow-ups. | the lifecycle skills |
| `issues/{slug}.md` | **Deferred code work**, pre-shaped from [`templates/ISSUE.md`](.agents/factory/templates/ISSUE.md) with `status: unshaped` | whoever defers it |
| `ROADMAP.md` | the **ordered index** — one entry per issue, `**Seed:**` pointing at the `issues/` file | whoever defers it |
| `spec/{slug}/` | work **actually in flight** | the lifecycle skills |

An `issues/{slug}.md` is a *candidate*, not a contract: `/xdu-feature` promotes it into
`spec/{slug}/GOAL.md`, and that promotion is where appetite, non-goals and R-IDs get negotiated. Never
copy one into a `GOAL.md` verbatim — `xdu-review` grades a GOAL, and an unshaped proposal is not a
contract anyone agreed to.

This coexists with the **GitHub tracker** (`AGENTS.md` already cites issues #2/#3): a GH issue is the
public-facing ticket, `issues/{slug}.md` is the pre-shaped spec behind it, and the two may link to each
other. Neither replaces the other.

## Architecture & data flow

```
xdu ──walk (jwalk + shared rayon pool)──▶ PartitionBuffer ──.partial──▶ fs::rename ──▶ <index>/<part>/NNNNNN.parquet
                                    │                                                         │
                        on success  └──▶ <index>/.xdu-complete  (run-level attestation)        │
                                                     │                                         │
xdu-find / xdu-view / xdu-rm ◀── warn if absent/errors ┘  ◀── DuckDB read_parquet('<index>/<part-or-*>/*.parquet') ◀┘
```

- **Index layout:** `<outdir>/<partition>/NNNNNN.parquet`, where `partition` is a top-level
  subdirectory name. Loose files directly under the indexed root go to the reserved partition
  **`__root__`** (`ROOT_PARTITION`, `lib.rs`), crawled with `max_depth(1)`. Readers glob `*/*.parquet`.
  `<index>/` holds exactly two kinds of entry — partition directories and the marker dotfile below —
  so **both** their names are reserved (`RESERVED_INDEX_NAMES`, `lib.rs`, pairing each name with what
  claims it). A top-level source subdirectory of either name is **rejected** by
  `crawl::build_work_queue`, which iterates that list: it would clobber the synthetic partition's chunk
  ids, or occupy the marker path and brick the outdir for every later run.
- **Run-level completion marker:** `<outdir>/.xdu-complete` (`COMPLETION_MARKER`, `lib.rs`) — a
  dotfile, so the readers' `*/*.parquet` glob never mistakes it for a partition. Per-chunk
  `.partial`→rename is atomic for one *file* but cannot express whether the **run** finished: when one
  driver fails, partitions that already succeeded stay on disk as real `.parquet` chunks,
  indistinguishable from a complete index. So the marker is **cleared once pre-flight has passed** and
  the crawl is about to write, and **written only on the success path** — its presence attests to the
  whole run. Body is `key=value` lines (`xdu`, `completed_at`, `files`, `bytes`, `vanished`,
  `errors`, `lossy_paths`, `format`), so an `--allow-errors` run still records how much it skipped;
  `format` carries the run-level index format version (`INDEX_FORMAT_VERSION`, `lib.rs`). All three
  readers call `lib::index_version_error` first and refuse — no rows, no deletions — when the marker
  states no version they understand, absent marker included; a versioned marker recording tolerated
  errors still only earns a **soft stderr warning** via `lib::index_completion_warning`. Reads are
  capped (`MARKER_READ_LIMIT`) and non-blocking, so a FIFO or huge file left at that path cannot
  hang or exhaust a reader. **Known limitation:** the marker
  describes the whole index but its counts come from one run, so a `--partition`-scoped run rewrites it
  from its own stats — see `issues/marker-scoped-run-attestation.md`.
- **Concurrency (indexer):** a **single** rayon pool (`Parallelism::RayonExistingPool`) backs **all**
  jwalk walkers; up to `--jobs` driver `std::thread`s pull partitions from a `Mutex<VecDeque>` work
  queue; rayon work-stealing balances directory reads across all active walkers so one huge partition
  can't starve the rest. `std::thread::scope` joins the drivers; the first `Err`/panic fails the run.
  Thread budget: N pool + C drivers + 1 main.
- **Atomic writes:** each chunk is written to `NNNNNN.parquet.partial`, then `fs::rename`d to
  `.parquet` in `finalize()` (atomic within a dir on POSIX); stale higher-numbered chunks from a prior
  larger run are pruned. This is **per-file** atomic, **not** per-partition atomic — see invariants.
- **Query:** `xdu-find`/`xdu-view`/`xdu-rm` open an in-memory DuckDB, glob the index, and apply a
  `QueryFilters` WHERE clause. `xdu-view` is a read-only TUI; `xdu-rm` unlinks the matched files.

## CLI surface (`src/cli.rs` is the one definition)

- `xdu DIR -o/--outdir DIR [-j/--jobs N (env XDU_JOBS, dflt 4)] [-B/--buffsize N (100000)]
  [--apparent-size] [-k/--block-size SIZE] [-p/--partition NAMES] [--allow-errors]`
  — `--allow-errors` is **opt-in**: by default any walk/stat error fails the run non-zero and no
  completion marker is written; with it, unreadable entries are counted, reported on stderr, the run
  exits 0, and the marker records the tolerated `errors=N`.
- `xdu-find -i/--index DIR (env XDU_INDEX) [-p/--pattern PATTERN] [--regex] [-u/--partition NAME]
  [--min-size/--max-size SIZE] [--older-than/--newer-than DAYS] [-f/--format path|size|atime|csv|json]
  [-l/--limit N] [-c/--count] [--top N]`
- `xdu-view -i/--index DIR [-u/--partition NAME] [-p/--pattern PATTERN] [--regex] [--min/max-size]
  [--older/newer-than] [-s/--sort name|size-asc|size-desc|count-asc|count-desc|age-asc|age-desc]`
- `xdu-rm -i/--index DIR [-p/--pattern PATTERN] [--regex] [-u/--partition] [--min/max-size]
  [--older/newer-than] [-l/--limit N] [-n/--dry-run] [--safe] [-f/--force] [-v/--verbose] [-j/--jobs (env XDU_JOBS)]`

**Footgun:** `-p` means `--partition` in `xdu` but `--pattern` in the three query tools (where
partition moves to `-u`). Same short flag, different meaning per binary — do not "fix" one side in
isolation.

## Load-bearing invariants (footguns)

The curated, numbered gate is [`.agents/factory/invariants.md`](.agents/factory/invariants.md),
kept **in lockstep** with this section (this file wins if they drift). The `xdu-plan` gate and the
`xdu-review` footgun checklist both draw from it. Summary of what must not silently break:

1. **Parquet schema stability.** `lib.rs::get_schema()` is the ONE contract: exactly eight
   **non-null** fields in fixed order — `path: Utf8`, `size: Int64`, `uid: Int64`,
   `gid: Int64`, `mode: Int64`, `atime: Int64`, `mtime: Int64`, `ctime: Int64`. Every reader
   selects these by name. The on-disk version is the `format` key in the `.xdu-complete` marker
   (`INDEX_FORMAT_VERSION`, `lib.rs`): version 2 names this eight-column layout, and every reader
   refuses a marker whose version it does not understand instead of misreading the rows — so any
   change to `get_schema()` or a reader's column list is a breaking, cross-cutting index-format
   change that must bump the version in the same commit (issues #2/#3 — owner/group/perms — are
   exactly this).
2. **Atomic finalization.** Write `NNNNNN.parquet.partial` → `fs::rename` (same dir) → prune stale
   higher chunks (`crawl.rs::PartitionBuffer::finalize()`). Never `File::create` a final `.parquet`,
   never cross-dir rename, never let a reader glob `.partial`. **Known limitation:** finalize is
   per-file, not per-partition atomic — do not index a partition while purging it. Run-level
   completeness is a *separate* mechanism: the `.xdu-complete` marker (see Architecture), cleared after
   pre-flight and written only on success. Never write it on a failure path.
3. **Partition scheme.** `<index>/<partition>/NNNNNN.parquet`; `__root__` reserved for loose
   top-level files (depth-1 walk); zero-padded sequential chunk ids; readers glob `*/*.parquet`. The
   index root's namespace is a **class, not two facts**: it holds partition directories plus the
   `COMPLETION_MARKER` dotfile, and *every* name in `lib::RESERVED_INDEX_NAMES` is **rejected** as a
   top-level source directory by `crawl::build_work_queue`, unconditionally — even when a `--partition`
   filter would exclude it, because the collision is with the layout, not with the selection. Reserving
   a new name at the index root means adding it to that list in the same commit; the guard iterates the
   list, so the rejection follows by construction.
4. **`xdu-rm` destructive safety.** Default requires interactive `y/N` (anything but `y`/`yes`
   aborts); `--dry-run` deletes nothing; `--force` skips the prompt; `--safe` re-stats each file
   immediately before unlink. **Any deletion combined with `--limit` MUST carry a deterministic
   `ORDER BY`** so `--dry-run` and the real run select identical rows.
5. **DuckDB injection surface.** Every user value reaching `read_parquet(...)`/`WHERE` is an
   injection surface. Route it through one validated escaping/quoting helper (or bound parameters);
   never raw `format!` a partition name or index path into SQL.
6. **Unix-only.** `MetadataExt` (atime; disk usage = `st_blocks`×512) is load-bearing; don't add
   code assuming portability. A future S3/Windows source must special-case (S3 has no atime).
7. **Shared rayon-pool concurrency.** See Architecture. Preserve the single-pool + driver-thread +
   work-stealing model and `thread::scope` error propagation.
8. **Symlinks excluded.** `follow_links(false)` + `is_file()` — the index holds only regular files.
9. **`SortMode` age inversion.** `age-desc` = oldest first = `atime ASC` (and vice versa); the SQL
   (`to_order_by`/`to_partition_order_by`) and `xdu-view`'s in-memory sort must agree.
10. **CLI single source of truth.** `src/cli.rs` is the one definition; completions and `doc/*.scd`
    describe it; a CLI change updates `doc/*.scd` in the same commit. Prefer clap `ValueEnum`/
    `value_parser` over late string validation.
11. **Altitude / testability.** Bins stay thin (arg parse, terminal setup/teardown, event loop);
    parsing/formatting/sniffing/SQL-building/state-transition logic lives in `lib` so tests reach it.
12. **TUI terminal safety.** Raw mode + alternate screen restore on **every** exit path including
    panic (Drop guard / panic hook, not sequential code — `panic="abort"` is set); previewed file
    bytes are `strip_ansi`-sanitized before rendering.
13. **Project conventions.** Version single-sourced from `Cargo.toml`; `share/` generated + ignored +
    CI-asserted; tarball layout (`bin/` + `share/{man,bash-completion,zsh}`) matches `install.sh`;
    non-TTY runs keep stdout clean/pipeable (progress → stderr); reuse shared helpers; **no `spec/`
    R#/P# ids in source** (they restart per feature and collide across branches); prose, comment and
    commit-message voice per § *Prose and comments*, which is hygiene rather than a review finding.

## High-risk files & footguns (quick reference)

- **`src/bin/xdu-rm.rs`** — destructive. `--limit` needs a deterministic `ORDER BY`; `--safe` must
  re-verify the criteria it claims to (atime/size today; min-size/newer-than/pattern are gaps); the
  confirm/dry-run/force gates are load-bearing.
- **`src/lib.rs`** — `get_schema()` (schema stability), `QueryFilters` (the SQL/injection surface),
  `index_glob` (the one place the index layout becomes SQL), and the `ROOT_PARTITION` /
  `COMPLETION_MARKER` layout constants with the `RESERVED_INDEX_NAMES` list that guards both.
- **`src/crawl.rs`** — `PartitionBuffer::finalize()` atomicity + stale-chunk pruning; the
  reserved-index-name collision rejection in `build_work_queue`; completion-marker write/clear ordering.
- **`src/bin/xdu.rs`** — the shared-pool concurrency model (driver threads, `thread::scope` error
  propagation); marker clear-after-pre-flight / write-on-success sequencing.
- **`src/bin/xdu-view.rs`** — terminal restore on panic; multibyte-safe truncation; empty-list
  bounds; unbounded preview memory.

## Testing

- `lib.rs` carries strong pure-function unit tests (parse_size, SizeMode, SortMode, QueryFilters,
  formatters, get_schema). Keep new logic in `lib` so it is testable.
- Integration tests in `tests/` drive the **real binaries** (`std::process::Command`) against real
  temp indexes (`tempfile` + `libc` dev-deps). **`tests/common/mod.rs` is the one home for binary
  resolution and fixtures** — every `tests/*.rs` carries `mod common;` and takes `binary_path` (which
  is `CARGO_BIN_EXE_*`, so a test always drives the artifact Cargo built for the profile under test),
  `build_index`, the `run_*` wrappers, and `set_atime_days_ago` (backdates atimes via `utimensat`)
  from it. A fixture that lives in one test file instead is how `rm_tests.rs` came to re-declare a
  `binary_path` that preferred whatever was lying in `target/release/`, so all 16 destructive tests
  ran a stale binary while `cargo test` stayed green. Never reimplement production logic in a test.
  Some cases self-skip where the platform can't host them (running as root; APFS rejecting non-UTF-8
  filenames) — a skipping test still prints `ok`, so check with `--nocapture` before trusting a green
  suite to mean a case actually ran.
- **`offline_tests.rs` guards air-gapped operation.** The readers must answer a query with an empty
  DuckDB extension cache and write nothing into it; the test redirects `HOME` and asserts that
  directory stays empty. This is why `Cargo.toml` asks `duckdb` for `parquet` alongside `bundled` —
  `bundled` alone leaves the Parquet reader to autoinstall a 12 MB extension at runtime. Dropping the
  feature restores a product defect on air-gapped HPC login nodes, not just a slow first run.
- **Verify by driving the CLI, not just tests.** Use `.agents/factory/bin/temp_index.sh` so a drive
  hits a throwaway index, never a real one. Exit 0 is necessary but not sufficient — assert a concrete
  post-condition (row count, a stdout token, files actually gone/kept).
- **Performance work is measured, not asserted.** `bench/` holds the crawl benchmark: `gen_tree.py`
  (sparse synthetic trees — full `stat` cost, ~0 disk), `run.sh` (the runner; emits one JSON document
  per invocation), `scenarios.md` (the shape table + comparability rules), `HPC-PROTOCOL.md` (the
  protocol community operators run on real Lustre/GPFS/ZFS), and the committed
  `results/baseline.json` reference. `sh bench/run.sh smoke` is the fast non-rot check and asserts the
  index holds exactly the generated files. **Comparing two builds requires an interleaved A/B in a
  single invocation** — `run.sh --compare-bin PATH` (build the older side in a `git worktree`, never
  a stash). Two separate invocations cannot resolve it: on the reference host the same binary drifts
  up to ~20% between invocations, and >2× on the flat-wide shape, so a two-document comparison
  measures the session, not the code. See `bench/scenarios.md` "The noise floor".

## Packaging & release

- `share/` is generated: man pages via `scdoc` from `doc/*.scd`; completions via `gen-completions`
  from `src/cli.rs`. The `.scd` sources carry **no version string**, so a pure version bump does not
  touch them — they change only when the CLI changes.
- Release profile (`Cargo.toml`): `lto = true`, `codegen-units = 1`, `panic = "abort"`, `strip = true`.
- Release tarball layout is a contract: `bin/{xdu,xdu-find,xdu-view,xdu-rm}` +
  `share/{man/man1/*.1, bash-completion/completions/*, zsh/site-functions/*}`; `install.sh`'s
  extraction mirrors it exactly. `/xdu-release` cuts versions (bump `Cargo.toml` + `Cargo.lock`,
  gate, tag, publish); see its skill.
- **Pre-release gate (mirrored by CI and `/xdu-release`):** `cargo fmt --all -- --check`,
  `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`, and `cargo test` must all pass clean.

## Working on this codebase as an agent

- **Use the factory for non-trivial work.** A feature/fix/refactor flows through the `.agents/`
  spec-driven lifecycle — `/xdu-feature` (shape `GOAL.md`) → `/xdu-plan` (research + `PLAN.md`/
  `TECH.md`) → `/xdu-build` (execute phases) → `/xdu-review` (blind, evidence-based QA) →
  `/xdu-publish` (squash PR to `main`), each on a `feature/`|`fix/` branch with artifacts under
  `spec/{slug}/`. `.agents/factory/methodology.md` is the *why*; `.agents/factory/invariants.md` is
  the curated footgun checklist derived from this file. **Ceremony scales to appetite** — a
  one-sentence change may skip the lifecycle entirely. Each lifecycle skill ends with a
  silence-by-default meta-note to `spec/{slug}/META.md`; `/xdu-publish` surfaces substantial notes in
  the PR; the human-gated **`/xdu-harness`** applies them back to `.agents/` (logging
  `factory/harness-log.md`) and **never weakens a non-negotiable gate** on a finding's say-so.
- **Cut releases with `/xdu-release`** (operational, not a lifecycle step): bump `Cargo.toml`, run the
  CI-mirror gate, sign a tag, publish — rehearsed in a `git worktree` dry-run and gated on an explicit
  human OK before any irreversible push.
- **Put logic where it belongs:** shared types/parsing/SQL-building in `lib`; keep bins thin. Don't
  duplicate a helper across bins (the crawl-test reimplementation is the anti-pattern).
- **Prose, comment and commit-message voice** per § *Prose and comments*, including the ban on
  feature-scoped spec ids in source.
- **This file is the map, but it drifts.** For a deep change, re-verify the specific invariant against
  the source before relying on it, and update this file when the code moves.
